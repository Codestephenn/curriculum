Introduction

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of all webpages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage using elements. These elements create paragraphs, headings, lists, images, links, and more. In this lesson, we’ll explore how HTML elements work and how to use them correctly.

Lesson Overview

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Understand what HTML tags are and how they function.

Differentiate between HTML elements and tags.


Elements and Tags

In HTML, most content is wrapped inside elements, which are created using tags.

Opening tags mark the start of an element and are enclosed in angle brackets < >.

Example: <p> (a paragraph opening tag).


Closing tags mark the end of an element. They are similar to opening tags but include a forward slash /.

Example: </p> (a paragraph closing tag).


Full HTML elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.


Example: A paragraph element

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Breakdown:

<p> → The opening tag.

This is a paragraph. → The content inside the element.

</p> → The closing tag.


Why Are Tags Important?

Tags define the structure of a webpage. The browser reads these tags and uses them to format the content correctly. Using the right tags improves:

1. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) – Search engines rely on proper HTML structure to rank pages accurately.


2. Accessibility – Assistive technologies like screen readers depend on correct HTML to interpret content for users with disabilities.



Using semantic HTML (choosing the right tag for the right purpose) improves both SEO and accessibility. You’ll learn more about this in a later lesson.

Void Elements (Self-Closing Tags)

Some HTML elements don’t have closing tags because they don’t wrap content. These are called void elements (or self-closing tags).

Examples of void elements:

<br>   <!-- Line break -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">   <!-- Image -->
<hr>   <!-- Horizontal line -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">   <!-- Input field -->

Historically, void elements were sometimes written with a self-closing slash (<br />, <img />). However, modern HTML does not require this, and the latest HTML standards consider it unnecessary.
